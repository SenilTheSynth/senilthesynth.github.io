So, the first step on the list is the ink tank! Yes, this isn't really "splatling exclusive", it would be part of any Splatoon cosplay I do (that's inspired by Splatoon 3, at least), but it'd house some fun electronics. I *was* toying with the idea of having the ink tank be the "brain" of the operations, with different splatlings (and other weapons, should I do that) having what amounts to a special identifier to say "Hey, I'm this guy, do these things!" which... *could* work, but would definitely be grounds for a "version 2.0" update. Right now, one microcontroller per unit. Ink tank is for show, maybe for power.

Probably also for power. It straps to your back, after all, and if I could monitor battery voltage I could set up some LEDs to represent a rough state-of-charge from 100% (full tank) to 0% (empty). But that takes away from a different design idea I'll bring up later.

## What material?

So, the number one question is the material. I want this to be something relatively easy to work with, that provides the look while still being fairly durable. I went to JoAnn's (regional craft stores? Or are they national, IDK) with my fiance to check out some options, and my initial thoughts were some kind of dark gray or black canvas. We did find some burlap-like material, which captured the look but you could see holes through it if you stretched it a bit. I found some duck canvas (right next to the burlap-like fabric) which hit that dark color plus durability point, though it's not quite as textured as the actual ink tank.

This is just meant to be a version 1.0, after all, and the ink tank will be the easiest to iterate on so long that I keep the dimensions somewhat similar.

## The dimensions

For all the builds - ink tank, splatlings, etc. - I'm referencing the appearance in-game with the inklings and octolings, and translating that perceived scale to my own. In-game the ink tank goes from just above the right shoulder, going down past their left hip. That is... pretty big to build in-person, and I don't think I need *quite* that large to sell the whole "this is an ink tank" bit. I decided that, since the ink tank isn't really "the star of the show" overall, I'd be fine with potential material mis-match as well as being off-scale.

I ended up measuring just below where a shirt collar sat to the small of my back, and the distance between my shoulderblades to get a rough approximation - for me, that was 18 inches tall, and 7 inches wide. Convert that as you want to. I'll probably add an inch or two on each dimension to make it a little larger, especially since it doesn't rest along your spine. Of course, I'd need the fabric purchased to be twice as large in some dimension, and all told that actually comes out to about one yard of fabric. Probably get three or four yards just to account for trial and error, templating, etc.

I've literally never sewed anything in my life, let alone use a sewing machine. Something that this ink tank is going to need.

## Extra bits

There are a couple other major things that go into the overall construction of the ink tank itself. One is more of a quality-of-life thing for me, so it's easier to get in and out while still looking sleek. Being a zipper, that runs along two sides of the tank so I can easily open it up, poke around in there, and zip it shut. The other is a plastic window of some kind for lighting - how I'll handle the lighting I don't know, but I'll handle it somehow.

The zipper just needs to be long enough to wrap around the length and width - I punched in 24 inches of zipper, though I might actually need 30 inches.
